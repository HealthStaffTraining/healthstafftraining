                    <h2>Jacqueline W.</h2>
                    <p>&lsaquo;&lsaquo; After being laid off of my job of 25 years I returned to my passion; helping people with substance abuse problems, and HealthStaff Training Institute was there to provide all of the education and training that I would need. The staff at Healthstaff was very friendly, helpful, and supportive; they cared about me as an individual, as well as my becoming a great counselor. Thanks to Healthstaff I was hired by the facility where I did my internship a week before graduating. My experience at Healthstaff is invaluable and has changed my life. I now have a very rewarding career; helping people gain sobriety and live productive lives!Â»
