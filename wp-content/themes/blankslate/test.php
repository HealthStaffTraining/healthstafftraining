            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>HealthStaff Training Institute (HSTi) began in September 1986 when the education and training division of Pharmacy Enterprises, Inc. formed an education division. When the anticipated expansion of HSTi exceeded the scope of Pharmacy Enterprises, the institute became a privately owned entity, carrying on the name of HealthStaff Training Institute. Since 1986, we have grown to offer a broad range of courses and a well-respected faculty. Our institute continues to evolve to accommodate the needs of the healthcare marketplace and the interest of our students. Every day we carry forward the mission to train and educate motivated and focused individuals into becoming efficient, capable allied health care or business professionals.</p>
